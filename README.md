Hz is an app that generates a sine wave and allow you to remotly control its **volume** and its **frequency** through HTTP requests.

The remote control is a Web App made for iPad.

This app is part of an art project for [Ã©cal](http://ecal.ch). The purpose of the project was to make a water flow looks freezed in the time.  
You can watch the concept of the project in this video: [Cool Sound and Water Experiment!](http://youtu.be/mODqQvlrgIQ)

Notes
-----

The volume control only works on Mac OS X for the moment.

The frequency sent by the Web App varies between **20Hz** and **30Hz**, but this can be changed in the client app.

API
---

If you want to develop another web app, here is HTTP requests you can send to the server:

Change the volume:

```
http://<your-computer-local-ip>:4040/controls/volume/<volume>
```

Change the frequency:

```
http://<your-computer-local-ip>:4040/controls/freq/<frequency>
```
